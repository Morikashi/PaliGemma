# PaliGemma: Your Gateway to Multimodal Language Processing
## üåê Introduction to PaliGemma

**PaliGemma**, unveiled at the 2024 Google I/O event, is an innovative multimodal model that combines the strengths of two advanced models: **SigLIP** (a vision model) and **Gemma** (a large language model). This powerful model integrates a Transformer decoder and a Vision Transformer image encoder, enabling it to process both image and text inputs and generate text outputs in multiple languages.
